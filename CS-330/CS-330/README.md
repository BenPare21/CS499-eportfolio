1. How do I approach designing software?

I start by defining the problem and requirements clearly. For this project, I broke down the work into manageable components, focusing on organization to ensure that each part could be developed and tested independently. Communication is key, so I make sure to seek clarification when needed.

2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project significantly enhanced my skills in organizing my work and thinking through design challenges. Working with OpenGL and GLSL files for the first time taught me how to create more intuitive user interfaces and prioritize usability in my designs.

3. What design process did you follow for your project work?

My design process began with gathering requirements and brainstorming ideas. I organized my components clearly and iterated on the design based on feedback from my professor. This approach allowed me to refine the designs and ensure they met the project's goals.

4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The organizational strategies I developed can be applied to future projects to enhance clarity and maintainability. I plan to seek clarification more proactively to ensure alignment and address any uncertainties early in the process.

5. How do I approach developing programs?

I take a systematic approach to program development, planning the overall architecture and breaking functionality into smaller tasks. Focusing on clean, maintainable code, I regularly test my work to catch any issues early in the development process.

6. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Since I was new to OpenGL, I had to learn about shaders and GLSL files while developing my 3D scene. I implemented continuous integration practices to test changes regularly and utilized version control effectively to manage my code.

7. How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was crucial throughout my development process. Feedback from testing phases allowed me to continuously refine my code and designs. Each iteration helped me identify and resolve bugs, ensuring that all components worked effectively before integrating them.

8. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Initially, my coding style was more ad-hoc due to my lack of experience with OpenGL. However, as I progressed through the milestones, I learned the importance of planning and organization, leading to a more structured approach. I began documenting my code and maintaining consistency in naming conventions.

9. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science provides a strong foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking. The programming and system design skills I've developed will enable me to tackle complex challenges and innovate solutions in my future endeavors.

10. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Working with computational graphics has deepened my understanding of algorithms and mathematical concepts. These skills will be beneficial for advanced studies in computer graphics and game development, helping me approach future projects with confidence.

11. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

The skills I've gained from working with OpenGL and shaders are relevant across various industries, including gaming and data visualization. Understanding how to create realistic models and animations prepares me for roles in software development and interactive media, enhancing my career prospects.
