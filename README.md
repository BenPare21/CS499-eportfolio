# Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a transformative experience, both personally and professionally. Through a wide range of projects and coursework, I have developed the technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative mindset necessary to succeed in the field of computer science. My ePortfolio is a culmination of this growth, showcasing work across software development, computer graphics, cybersecurity, and full-stack web development.

Over the course of the program, I gained hands-on experience working with real-world tools, languages, and development frameworks. For example, in CS-320, I learned how to design software that not only functions well but also addresses user needs through secure, user-centered practices. This experience sharpened my ability to think critically about usability and securityâ€”two pillars of successful software today.

In addition to individual development, I also learned the value of collaborating in a team environment. In multiple courses, I participated in team-based assignments that required version control with Git, code reviews, and shared planning. These experiences taught me how to contribute constructively, resolve conflicts, and build reliable software as part of a teamâ€”skills that are directly applicable in professional settings.

Communicating with stakeholders has also been an important part of my journey. Whether presenting progress updates in team meetings or writing clear documentation for technical and non-technical audiences, Iâ€™ve learned how to tailor my communication style based on audience needs. This skill was especially critical in CS-320, where user feedback directly shaped software design decisions.

From a technical standpoint, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, including linked lists, sorting algorithms, binary trees, and recursive logic. These fundamentals were applied across different projects and helped me write efficient, scalable code. In CS-260, I created algorithmic solutions for managing and analyzing data, which improved my confidence in computational thinking and performance optimization.

My knowledge of software engineering and databases was greatly enhanced in courses like CS-340 and CS-465. I became proficient in building RESTful APIs, designing schemas in MongoDB, and implementing secure authentication protocols such as JWT. I also learned software lifecycle practices, version control with GitHub, and agile methodologies that support iterative, test-driven development.

Security was another consistent focus across the program. From input validation and password hashing to secure session handling, Iâ€™ve applied key security principles that ensure the software I build is robust and resilient. In CS-320 and CS-465, security wasn't just an afterthoughtâ€”it was integrated into each development stage, preparing me to build systems that meet todayâ€™s security expectations.

My ePortfolio brings these experiences together. Each artifact showcases a different area of computer science, from OpenGL graphics programming (CS-330) to full-stack web development (CS-465) and secure software engineering (CS-320). Together, they represent a well-rounded skill set and a professional who is ready to contribute meaningfully to any development team.

As I begin the next chapter of my career, I am motivated by a desire to keep learning and to apply my skills toward meaningful, high-impact projects. I value maintainable, secure code and believe that technology should be intuitive, reliable, and built with care. Iâ€™m proud of what Iâ€™ve accomplished in this program and look forward to bringing that same energy and dedication to my future work in the computer science field.
