## CS-320 Project: Secure, User-Centered Software Development

The CS-320 project focused on designing and developing secure, functional software that meets user needs through a structured and iterative development process.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Applied comprehensive testing and security best practices  
- Conducted user research and incorporated continuous feedback  
- Used modular, maintainable design and iterative refinement  

*Reflection:* This project strengthened my ability to blend technical rigor with user-focused design principles.

## CS-330 Project: 3D Graphics with OpenGL — Mug on a Table

This project involved building a 3D scene using OpenGL, featuring a mug on a table, emphasizing shaders, textures, lighting, and camera controls.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Modeled basic 3D objects with textures and lighting  
- Implemented camera navigation with AWSD, QE, and mouse controls  
- Organized code modularly despite some technical challenges  

*Reflection:* The project provided valuable insight into graphics programming and managing complex codebases.

## CS-465 Project: Full-Stack Web Application for Trip Management

In this project, I developed a full-stack web application that allows users to view and manage trip information securely.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Built a backend API with Express and MongoDB, using Mongoose for schema design  
- Implemented JWT-based authentication to secure sensitive routes  
- Refactored code for better error handling, created reusable UI components, and optimized data fetching  
- Validated form inputs on both client and server sides for robustness  

*Reflection:* This project expanded my full-stack development skills and deepened my understanding of web application security and scalability.
